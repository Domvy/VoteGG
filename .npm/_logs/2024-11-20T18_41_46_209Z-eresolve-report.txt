# npm resolution error report

While resolving: openvidu-react@2.30.0
Found: react@17.0.1
node_modules/react
  react@"17.0.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^18.0" from react-redux@9.1.2
node_modules/react-redux
  react-redux@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
